**凯文**·**凯利**（Kevin Kelly / KK），《失控》一书的作者。文章原意是68条不请自来的建议，就像有人会抱怨年老的人喜好给人建议，这应该是KK的幽默。他在68岁生日时把这些建议作为礼物，送给年轻人。

---

- Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe. 学会如何从那些你不认同你，甚至是冒犯你的人身上学习。看看你能否从他们坚信的东西里发现真理。【包容不同观点，处处可学习】
- Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points. 充满激情价值25点智商。
-  Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the  ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better. 总要设置最后期限。最后期限可以排除无关紧要的东西，让你避免完美主义，你只需要做自己就好。做自己好过完美主义。【设限意味着有成果，而不是无望。成果可以迭代。】
- Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of  the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too  embarrassed to ask it. 别害怕提出听上去很蠢的问题，因为其他人99%的情况下也在思考同样的问题，却羞于提问。
- Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone  you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, until there is no more. 认真倾听是一种超能力。对你感兴趣的人问一句“还有吗？”，直到你满意为止。【做一个倾听者，更要学会提问】

---


- A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier. 有价值的年度目标，是充分的研究一个主题，你会发现自己一年前是多么无知。【芒格既是如此，集火填补知识空缺】
- Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at. 感恩可以解锁其他美德，也会让你更优秀。
- Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s  powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends. 没什么不是一顿饭可以解决的。无论对老朋友还是结交新朋友，请吃饭都是简单有效的方法。
- Don’t trust all-purpose glue. 不要相信万灵药。
- Reading to your children regularly will bond you together and kickstart their imaginations. 定期和孩子一起阅读能使你们更亲密，也会开启他们的想象力。【阅读的效力】

- Never use a credit card for credit. The only kind of credit, or debt, that is acceptable is debt to acquire something whose exchange value is extremely likely to increase, like in a home. The exchange value of most things diminishes or vanishes the moment you purchase them. Don’t be in debt to losers. 永远不要使用信用卡消费。只有那些交换价值极有可能升值的债务才值得接受，比如房产。大部分物品的交换价值在你买到的时候就已经减少或消失。不要欠失败者（loser）的债。
- Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.行家只是那些能优雅应对失误的外行人。【试错成本】
- Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed. 非凡的主张要有非凡的佐证才可信。
- Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.别做房间里最聪明的人。和比自己更聪明的人在一起，学习他们。更好的情况是，找到和你意见不一样的聪明人。
- Rule of 3 in conversation. To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth.谈话的三次法则：想得到真正的原因，让对方在回答的基础上更进一步，然后第二次次、第三次。最后的回答会接近事实。

---

- Don’t be the best. Be the only. 不必做到最好，而要做唯一的那个。
- Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce  yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they  are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead. 人都会害羞。别人都在等着你给他们介绍你自己，他们等着你给他们发邮件，等着你聚会的邀请。行动吧。【主动！】
- Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they  are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing  how often a second try works. 被人拒绝时不要太当回事。设想他们像你一样：忙碌、无暇旁顾、心烦意乱。再试一次，神奇的是第二次努力常常能成功。
- The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from  self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to  flossing. 习惯的目的是消除内心的自我斗争。你就不会耗费精力去决定该做什么。做就是了。好习惯包括从说真话到用牙线的方方面面。【选择太多是大问题】
- Promptness is a sign of respect. 守时是尊重的表现。【计划和提前量】

---

- When you are young spend at least 6 months to one year living as  poor as you can, owning as little as you possibly can, eating beans and  rice in a tiny room or tent, to experience what your “worst” lifestyle  might be. That way any time you have to risk something in the future you won’t be afraid of the worst case scenario. 年轻时你如果一年里有半年多时间活的贫困，身上财物少之又少，在陋室里吃糠咽菜，体验到你“最糟”的生活状态。这样之后任何时候你不得不冒险时，你就不会害怕最差的情况出现。【苦日子的作用，避免打击惨重】
- Trust me: There is no “them”. 相信我，并没有所谓的“他们”。【和为贵】
- The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested. 你越对他人感兴趣，他们也越会发现你的有趣之处。互相发现彼此。【还是主动】
- Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away. 变得慷慨一点。没人在临死前会后悔给别人太多。
- To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just  re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in  remaking them. 想要做好一件事，就放手去做。想要做到极致，只要重复、重复、再重复。创造美好的秘密恰恰在重塑他们之中。【乔丹，repeat x3】

- The Golden Rule will never fail you. It is the foundation of all other virtues. 黄金法则不会骗你。它是其他所有美德的基础。【黄金法则：你希望别人怎样对待你，你就先怎样对待别人】

- If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally  find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it. 你在家里找一样东西，终于找到的时候，不要把它放回到你找到它的地方，而是放回到首先想到的地方。【物品归位】

- Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small  amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without  deliberation is one path to wealth. 省钱和投资都是好习惯。几十年里定期投资小量而不过于斟酌考虑，是致富的一个方式。【避免过度操作，长期投资】

- To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing  elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal  responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is. 人都会犯错。犯错的经验是宝贵的。没有什么比很快承认并对自己犯的错误负责，然后诚恳的改正，更能让一个人得到进步了。搞砸了就承认。承担责任的力量大到让人无法相信。【认错，人人会犯错】

- Never get involved in a land war in Asia. 千万别陷入亚洲陆地战场。【对美军来说亚洲是噩梦，不要妄图一口吃下大蛋糕】

- You can obsess about serving your customers/audience/clients, or you  can obsess about beating the competition. Both work, but of the two,  obsessing about your customers will take you further. 你可以专注为客户/观众/顾客服务，也可以致力于赢得竞争。二者都可行，但前者会让你走的更远。

- Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up. 展示自己。持续的展示自己。成功人士说过：展示出来就成功了99%。

- Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write  and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select.  While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t  reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from  judgement. 把创造和改进的过程分开。你不能同时写作又编辑，雕刻又打磨，或者创造又分析。如果这样做，编辑者会阻碍创作者。当你发明创造，就不要做选择。当你规划草图时，不要做复查。当你写初稿，不要反思。一开始的时候，创造性思维必须和判断一分为二。

- If you are not falling down occasionally, you are just coasting. 如果你不是偶然跌倒，你只是闲逛而已。【低概率？】

- Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that  the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is  the beginning of wisdom. 也许宇宙中最反直觉的真理，就是你给予他人越多，你得到的越多。理解这一点正是智慧的开端。

- Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends  can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than  owning a boat. 朋友比金钱宝贵。钱能买来大部分东西，朋友能让你得到更多。很多时候，一位有船的朋友好过你拥有一艘船。
- This is true: It’s hard to cheat an honest man. 这是真的：你很难欺骗一个诚实的人。
- When an object is lost, 95% of the time it is hiding within arm’s  reach of where it was last seen. Search in all possible locations in  that radius and you’ll find it. 一样东西找不到，95%的可能它离最后出现的地方近在咫尺。在那附近所有可能的地方找找看，你一定能找到。
- You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on. 你的行为决定你是什么样的人。你不是你的话语、信念或者投票给谁决定的，你把花在哪里，决定了你。【用行动说话，结果就是你自己】
- If you lose or forget to bring a cable, adapter or charger, check  with your hotel. Most hotels now have a drawer full of cables, adapters  and chargers others have left behind, and probably have the one you are  missing. You can often claim it after borrowing it. 要是你忘带或者弄丢充电器、插头、电源线，去旅馆前台问问。大部分旅馆都有一抽屉其他人的遗失物，也许有一个是你丢失的那个。你可以借一个走，然后说那是自己的。【也算是物尽其用】

---

- Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison. 怨恨不会损伤你怨恨的人，怨恨别人只会毒害自己。把怨恨当作毒药一样丢弃。
- There is no limit on better. Talent is distributed unfairly, but  there is no limit on how much we can improve what we start with. 精益求精没有止境。天赋不会公平分配，但没人限制我们从起点开始不断提升。
- Be prepared: When you are 90% done any large project (a house, a  film, an event, an app) the rest of the myriad details will take a  second 90% to complete. 准备好：当你完成一项大工程的90%，比如房子、电影、会议、软件，剩下的大量细节会消耗又一个90%的时间。【二八定律的延续】
- When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation. 你死后能留下的，只有你的名声。
- Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and  listen. Nobody talks about the departed’s achievements. The only thing  people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were  achieving. 年纪大了，尽可能多的参加葬礼，去倾听。没有人会讨论逝者的成就，人们能记住的只有你在拼搏道路上是哪种人。

---

- For every dollar you spend purchasing something substantial, expect  to pay a dollar in repairs, maintenance, or disposal by the end of its  life.  每花一块钱购买有价值的东西时，别忘了可能还要花一块钱，用来在它老旧之后修补和销毁处理。

- Anything real begins with the fiction of what could be. Imagination  is therefore the most potent force in the universe, and a skill you can  get better at. It’s the one skill in life that benefits from ignoring  what everyone else knows. 任何现实都从虚构的可能开始。想象力是宇宙中最强大的力量，也是让你更优秀的技能。它是可以从忽略其他人所知而获益。【你不需要知道什么才开始想象】

- When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress. 当危机和灾难来袭，别错失机会。没有问题，就没有改进。

- On vacation go to the most remote place on your itinerary first,  bypassing the cities. You’ll maximize the shock of otherness in the  remote, and then later you’ll welcome the familiar comforts of a city on the way back. 假期里先去旅程中最远的地方，别去城市。你会在偏远的地方感受最强烈的差异感，然后返程时去城市，感受城市中熟悉的舒适感。

- When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask  yourself: would you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not  too many promises will pass that immediacy filter. 当你收到邀请未来要做某件事，问问自己：要是明天就要去做，你会接受邀请吗？没有多少承诺会通过这种迫切性筛选。

  ---

- Don’t say anything about someone in email you would not be comfortable saying to them directly, because eventually they *will* read it. 那些当面说都觉得不舒服的话，也不要在邮件里对别人说，因为最终他们会读到。

- If you desperately need a job, you are just another problem for a  boss; if you can solve many of the problems the boss has right now, you  are hired. To be hired, think like your boss. 如果你只是迫切需要一份工作，那你只是老板的另一个麻烦；如果你能解决老板眼前的很多麻烦，你会被雇用。想要一份工作，要从老板角度思考。

- Art is in what you leave out. 艺术是自然流露出来的。

- Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will. 拥有物品很少会带给你深度的满足，但拥有经验却可以。

- Rule of 7 in research. You can find out anything if you are willing to go seven levels. If the first source you ask doesn’t know, ask them  who you should ask next, and so on down the line. If you are willing to  go to the 7th source, you’ll almost always get your answer. 研究七层法则：你可以通过七层关系找到任何想要找寻的对象。如果你提问的第一个对象回答不知道，问他们接下来应该问谁，然后依此继续。如果你能够找到第七个信息来源，通常都能找到答案。

- How to apologize: Quickly, specifically, sincerely. 如何道歉：迅速、明确、真诚。
- Don’t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise. 不要在电话里回复请求或提议。紧急都是假装的。
- When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend  they have a disease. That makes it easier to have empathy toward them  which can soften the conflict. 当有人对你下流、粗鲁、怨恨、刻薄，假装觉得他们有病好了。这样更容易同情他们，缓和冲突。
- Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures. 清理杂物，给房间里真正重要的希望留出空间。
- You really don’t want to be famous. Read the biography of any famous person. 你不会想出名的。读任何名人的传记就知道了。【名声的两面性】

---

- Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for  skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing  them for the first time. 工作经验被高估了。因资质而被招聘，受培训以获得技能。大多数真正惊人或伟大的事物，都是被第一次接触的人完成的。
- A vacation + a disaster = an adventure. 假期 + 灾难 = 冒险
- Buying tools: Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can  find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford. 购买工具：从你能找到的最便宜的工具买起。升级那些使用频繁的工具。如果你的工作很依赖，那就买你能承受的最好的工具。
- Learn how to take a 20-minute power nap without embarrassment. 学会如何毫不尴尬的来一次20分钟的小憩。
- Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know  what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is “master  something, anything”. Through mastery of one thing, you can drift  towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and  eventually discover where your bliss is. 如果不知道自己热爱什么，追随内心喜悦是一种跳出困顿的方法。对大多数年轻人来说，更好的座右铭是“精于一事，拓展其他”。通过专精于一样东西，你会向着带给你更多喜悦的方向前进，最终发现你的快乐所在。【专于一件事】

- I’m positive that in 100 years much of what I take to be true today  will be proved to be wrong, maybe even embarrassingly wrong, and I try  really hard to identify what it is that I am wrong about today. 我敢肯定，很多今天认为是正确的东西，100年后会被证明是错的，甚至可能错的离谱，而我也在努力分辨我今天错在哪里。
- Over the long term, the future is decided by optimists. To be an  optimist you don’t have to ignore all the many problems we create; you  just have to imagine improving our capacity to solve problems. 从长远看，为了取决于乐观主义。做一个乐观主义者，你不必忽略今天我们造成的种种问题，而是要设想提升能力去解决这些问题。
- The universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success. This will be much easier to do if you embrace this pronoia. 整个宇宙都在你身后暗暗助力你去成功。如果你有这种偏执，成功就容易很多。
